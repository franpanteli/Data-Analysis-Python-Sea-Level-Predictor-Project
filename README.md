# Data-Analysis-Python-Sea-Level-Predictor-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCamp's [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python#data-analysis-with-python-course) certification, to invest in my data analytics skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work as part of the [third project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer) in this curriculum. I devised a Python script for this, which used Numpy to produce plots by analysing medical data. 

### Workflow
#### Task Brief
Notes on the task brief for this project were first written, which are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). The project boilerplate files were next cloned in a Gitpod environment. This included CSV data involving the medical information of patients ([medical_examination.csv](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/medical_examination.csv)). Python was desired which produced two output plots for this data. Two aim plots were provided for this, which are in the [Aim](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/tree/main/Aim) directory in this repository and also given below.

#### Writing The Project medical_data_visualizer.py File
The `draw_cat_plot` and `draw_heat_map` functions were next written in the project [medical_data_visualizer.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/medical_data_visualizer.py) file, to generate plots of this nature using the input data. This file was annotated with problem-solving approaches and sections of it were pasted into the [Plots.ipynb](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/Plots.ipynb) file for further visualisation. This performed calculations on the project data and generated the plots in the [Output Files](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/tree/main/Output%20Files) directory. These output plots are also provided below.

#### Submission & Testing
Project files were pushed to this repository once all unit tests ([test_module.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/py%20Files/test_module.py) and [main.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/py%20Files/main.py)) had successfully passed and its URL was submitted. This aided in developing statistical and data analytics skills with Numpy and marked the completion of the third project in the course.
